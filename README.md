# NGS Augment Simulator
A small tool to simulate gear and augment choices in PSO2: NGS

# Errors and omissions
If you see anything wrong, please open an issue or submit a PR to fix it.
Notably, I'm missing Battle Power values for a bunch of augments.

# Planned Features
- Loadout comparison
- Level / BP damage attenuation calculation
- Weapon / Technique / Class Skill attack selection (instead of manual attack potency input)
- Class Skill modifiers (for passive and active buffs)

# Known bugs
- Sometimes the loading process fails. Ctrl+f5 should fix it in most cases.
- Status resistance penalties from geant armor aren't calculated properly. 

# Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Deathcreem for stat dumps and to the pso2 ngs wiki maintainers for gear and augment listings.
